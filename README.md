## Project 1 - Detection of Pollen Foragers 
Honeybees are a popular model system to study collective behavior. Similar to us humans, bees collect and communicate information among their peers. In our project “BeesBook” we try to understand how a colony integrates various kinds of information and “computes” a colony response to the challenges posed by the environment. Bees, for example, have to collect protein-rich pollen to raise their young. But who becomes a pollen forager, who collects nectar? In this project we want to detect bees that have collected pollen - visible as small nuggets stuck to their hind legs. Our goal is to train a convolutional neural network that can detect these “pollen baskets”.
